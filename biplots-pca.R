# Basic plots for both the variables in the time series and the countries, histograms and box plots
# Document the variables and the measurements units
# Check multi correspondance  analysis in factomine, combine it with clustering
# Change factoextra with factominer
# In case the cluster plot still doesnt work, we can check the box plots for each cluster manually to see differences between them
